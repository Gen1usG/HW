                    They say once you grow crops somewhere, you have officially colonized it. So, technically, I
                    colonized Mars. In your face, Neil Armstrong!

                       The main trafic from Earth to our Mar outpost is space ship. It is very big even bigger than aircraft carrier. 
                       However, the ship can only take 50 to 70 people once. This is because that most room of the ship is used to 
                       save the fiel and the materials which are necesssary to the outpost on the Mars. Due to the development of 
                       technology, the voyage will last for half a month and we have 5 different shipes which means we can deliver 
                       goods to outpost frequently

                       Nearly 56% of land is used to grow crops. We grow vegetable and fruits on Mars because we can ship flour and rice from earth and can save many land(the reason is that
                       rice and flour can be reserve for long time, it is more necessary to grow some food which cannot be reserved for a long time)
                       When working in the field, you can see very beautiful sky through the cover. Some people even say there is another heaven

                        The weather in the Mars is very bad, so we strongly recommand that please do not go out the cover because you maybe hurt or die.
                        on the other hand, storm is a kind of very beautiful landscape which people cannot find
                        on Earth. The weather action is stronger than on earth, so if you stay in side the cover
                        you can keep safe and take good pictures

                        There is a big difference in building style between Earth and Mars. On earth, we can build very high and huge buildings because the land is strong whcin 
                        make a foundation can hold whole buildings. However, the land on Mars cannot hold that and this is the reason why all buildings are like factory in Earth(
                        low hight and with a big area.) Also because of air is very important, we build many chimney with a lot of filters to make sure that all emission will not
                        pollut the air in cover.
